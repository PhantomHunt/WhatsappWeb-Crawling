# WhatsappWeb-Crawling
In this project I am crawling Whatsapp Web to retrieve all the chats and media from all contacts.  

# Requirements:
Prior Knowledge of Python and selenium
install selenium- pip install selenium

# Explaination

I am using edge driver. You can use any but must install it and give its .exe path in the driver variable.

I recommend using spider ide. I am also putting .pynb file for people who work in anaconda jupyter notebook.

If you use jupyter notebook open it in different browser as selenium closes the browser whose web driver is used.
I use chrome for anaconda and have webdriver for Microsoft edge.

All the problems in the code are well described in comments and still if you find any difficulty, please whatsapp me -8527467123
