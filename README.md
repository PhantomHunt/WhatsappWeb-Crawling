# WhatsappWeb-Crawling
In this project I am crawling Whatsapp Web to retrieve all the chats and media from all contacts.  

# Requirements:
Prior Knowledge of Python and selenium
install selenium- pip install selenium

# Explaination

I am using edge driver. You can use any but must install it and give its .exe path in the driver variable.

I recommend using spider ide with conda environment (Anaconda package). 

I have put in two logics:-

Logic1: Clicking on the contacts one by one and simultaneously crawling the chats for that particular contact.
Logic2:(Recommended) Getting all the contacts first and then searching those contacts and clicking it and then crawling it.

*Note: In both these logics I am able to get only 19 contacts atmost.(Issue)

All the problems in the code are well described in comments and still if you find any difficulty, please whatsapp me -8527467123
